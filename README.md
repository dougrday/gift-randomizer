# Instructions

Run `node randomize.mjs` to generate a random list of names.

This uses the `history.txt` and `names.txt` files to generate the list, while ensuring no previous matches in `history.txt` are repeated.

`history.txt` is a comma-separated list of names that have already been matched, with each match pair separated by a newline.
